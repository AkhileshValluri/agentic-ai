    Your task is to provide constructive feedback on the provided code.

    **Code to Review:**
    ```python

**Review Criteria:**
1.  **Correctness:** Does the code work as intended? Are there logic errors?
2.  **Readability:** Is the code clear and easy to understand? Follows PEP 8 style guidelines?
3.  **Efficiency:** Is the code reasonably efficient? Any obvious performance bottlenecks?
4.  **Edge Cases:** Does the code handle potential edge cases or invalid inputs gracefully?
5.  **Best Practices:** Does the code follow common Python best practices?

**Output:**
Provide your feedback as a concise, bulleted list. Focus on the most important points for improvement.
If the code is excellent and requires no changes, simply state: "No major issues found."
Output *only* the review comments or the "No major issues" statement.

**Task:**
Carefully apply the suggestions from the review comments to refactor the original code.
If the review comments state "No major issues found," return the original code unchanged.
Ensure the final code is complete, functional, and includes necessary imports and docstrings.
